## Step 3: Configure Your CNC Machine
 
To configure your CNC machine, you need to create or edit an XML file that contains the settings for your machine, such as the number of axes, the steps per unit, the motor tuning, the input and output signals, etc. You can use the default XML file that comes with ArtSoft Mach3 R3.043.066 or you can create your own using the Config menu in the software. You can also find XML files for different types of CNC machines on the internet or on the [Machsupport Forum](https://www.machsupport.com/forum/index.php). To load your XML file, rename it to Mach3Mill.xml (or Mach3Turn.xml for a lathe) and copy it to the same folder where you installed ArtSoft Mach3 R3.043.066.
 
## Step 4: Connect Your CNC Machine
 
To connect your CNC machine, you need to have a parallel port or a USB port on your computer and a compatible cable that connects to your CNC machine's controller board. You also need to have a power supply for your CNC machine and a switch to turn it on and off. Make sure that your computer and your CNC machine are turned off before connecting them. After connecting them, turn on your power supply and then turn on your computer.
 
## Step 5: Run ArtSoft Mach3 R3.043.066
 
To run ArtSoft Mach3 R3.043.066, double-click on the Mach3Mill.exe (or Mach3Turn.exe) icon on your desktop or in the folder where you installed the software. You will see a splash screen and then a profile selection window where you can choose your XML file or create a new one. After selecting your profile, you will see the main interface of ArtSoft Mach3 R3.043.066 where you can control your CNC machine.

Your G-code file should have a .nc or .tap extension and it should contain the instructions for your CNC machine to create your desired shape or size from your material.
